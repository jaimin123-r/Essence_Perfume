            Welcome to Essence, where we believe that every fragrance tells a story. Our journey began

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Founded in 2020, Essence has grown from a small collection of artisanal perfumes to
            a curated gallery of finest fragrances from around the world. We work directly with
            master perfumers who share our commitment to quality and creativity.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We believe that perfume is more than just a scent â€“ it's an invisible accessory that
            completes your personal style. Each fragrance in our collection is carefully selected
            to offer a unique olfactory experience.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-amber-900 mt-12 mb-4">Quality Promise</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Every perfume in our collection undergoes rigorous quality testing. We source only the
            finest ingredients and work with renowned perfume houses to ensure exceptional quality
            in every bottle.
